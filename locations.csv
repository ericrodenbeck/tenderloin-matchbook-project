Bone's Corner,"“Bones,” a San Francisco native of at least two generations, is described in several SF Chronicle articles as “the city’s leading gambler” and kingpin of the Tenderloin. He first gained national attention for his 1963 involvement in a public brawl, which included the actress Clara Bow. Bones operated the “swank” Cal-Neva lodge at Lake Tahoe, and used it to launder money for bank-robbers and gangsters. He also operated a card room (frequented by famous criminals such as Nick the Greek and Ty Thompson) at the Menlo Club (30 Turk St.), until it was shut down by a dramatic police investigation. Bones is described by the president of the police commission as ""an undesirable character [who] will be driven out of the city."" He sold both businesses in 1950 while facing charges for racketeering and tax evasion, but maintained indirect control of each and kept stakes in El Cerrito and the Tenderloin (B-R Smoke Shop, 186 Club, Day-Night Cigar Store, One-Ten Eddy Club, Tiny's Waffle Shop and Transit Smoke Shop), for money laundering purposes.

He, along with other underworld types bought shares of the nonoperating corporation Mountain City Consolidated Copper Co., prompting an interstate investigation. His court case erupted into quite a scene when the judge threatened to hold his attorney (former reporter and showman Leslie Gillen) in contempt for ""back-talk."" The trial revealed his nation-wide gambling connections and nightclub investments and large money transfers prior to elections. They also showed his habit of buying expensive ties for employees and friends, revealing an income much larger than officially reported. Bones was sentenced to 5 years in prison and given a $20,000 fine in February 1952, but was granted a new trial by the US supreme court. After serving 2 1/2 years in prison, Bones secretly reacquired Bone's Corner from its nominal owner, Leonard Wood. He was reconvicted and forced to sell off his assets to pay the $863,000 he owed in fines and taxes. Bones lived out the rest of his days selling used cars for his brother and died in 1963.

Bobby Watson Tuxedo Club,"Bobby Watson Tuxedo Club was ruled ""out of bounds"" by the army and navy in 1944. In 1942 it got in trouble for serving alcohol past 2 a.m., and in 1946 it faced an infraction for not having the correct restaurant equipment. In 1955 a B-Girl named Nelda and the bartender Sonny were arrested for employing a bar girl and wildly changing the prices of drinks. Nelda allegedly fondled a state officer and enticed him to buy drinks, racking up a total of $25. A day later, a district attorney ruled that the two could not be prosecuted because Nelda was co-owner of the bar. The case was contested by the State Liquor Director who eventually would file charges to plug the legal loophole. When asked where Nelda had acquired the money to buy into the business, she admitted to receiving the $3000 from a married bar equipment salesman who she didn't want to embarass. As Nelda was in court, co-owner James W. McQuade, a disabled former policeman, was arrested on charges of being a bookmaker. On October 6 1955 their liquor license was revoked.",P003_04.jpg,-122.4111122,37.7829663,,
